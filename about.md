# To-Do List

My first geode mod! Mod by [NinSam](user:20754112)

Adds a button in the editor in the `undo-menu` tab that adds a To-Do List. 

Now you don't need to place text objects to make a To-Do List! 

You can also customize the color of the button at the bottom of the settings. (Requires exiting and reopening the editor for the button color to change)
